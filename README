SUSolve is a C++ based command line tool for solving Sudokus. The core algorithms
were first written to solve project Euler problem 96, and later an improved
implementation was used as a graduation project for Frank Brokken's C++ course.

Currently, I (plan to) use this as a test project for learning/testing new tools
like:

-Pthreads/OpenMP in C++
-CMake, including testing and installation
-GIT
-Doxygen
